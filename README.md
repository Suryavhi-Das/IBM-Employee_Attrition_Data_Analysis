# 🔹 Insight 1: Experience-Based Attrition Spike

Employees with 0–5 years and around 10 years of experience show the highest attrition

Root causes:

Lower salary hikes

Reduced job satisfaction

Career stagnation concerns

📌 Interpretation: Employees reassess growth opportunities during early and mid-career stages.

# 🔹 Insight 2: R&D + Overtime = High Attrition

R&D employees working overtime have low job satisfaction (~2.54)

This combination results in the highest attrition rate

📌 Interpretation: High workload without adequate rewards leads to burnout.

# 🔹 Insight 3: Demographic Pattern

Male employees show higher attrition than females

Single employees leave more frequently than married employees

📌 Interpretation: Lack of personal stability and work-life balance plays a major role.
